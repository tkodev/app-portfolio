Designed to improve operational integrity and real-time decision-making, this modernization project bridges advanced technology with critical field applications.',
    desc: 'As part of the Beyond MPD modernization project, I co-developed an event-driven architecture using event brokers to ensure reliable communication across control systems interfacing with oil rig panels, communication buses, and PLCs. I collaborated on building a design system in Figma, enabling a consistent and intuitive user interface across applications. I contributed to back-end solutions supporting the calibration of chokes and sensors, while co-authoring interpolation algorithms for precise fluid pressure control with rigorous unit testing. Leveraging SVG and Canvas, I designed real-time and historical data visualization solutions capable of tracking over 10,000 data points with subsecond tolerance. Additionally, I developed robust validation schemas, optimized CI/CD pipelines, and ensured global deployment compatibility through precise unit conversion standards. My role also involved creating project management presentations to enhance team efficiency and streamline processes. Beyond is poised to set new standards in the industry, with more details to come post-launch.',

    intro:
      'Transforming Aeroplan’s digital ecosystem, I played a key role in designing and implementing solutions that spanned multiple projects, from software architecture and initial MVP, to e-commerce experiences pioneering accessibility and cross-browser compatibility. These initiatives revolutionized how users interacted with Aeroplan’s services, enabling seamless reward earning, better user experiences, and regulatory compliance across their platform.',
    desc: `
      My engagements with Aeroplan encompassed a diverse range of projects that addressed user experience, accessibility, and technical scalability across their ecosystem:
      
      **Aeroplan Shopping Button Browser Extension**: As the lead developer, I architected Aeroplan’s first cross-browser web extension, which supported hundreds of retailer sites. The extension enabled users to earn points seamlessly while shopping online. Utilizing an SWR-based query system, I overcame CORS limitations to provide real-time updates, implemented multi-domain navigation tracking for uninterrupted purchase sessions, and designed a multi-layer caching system to reduce backend load and enhance performance.
      
      **Aeroplan Retailer and Catalog Redesign**: I spearheaded the implementation of the eStore’s retailer catalog and filtering system redesign to create a more intuitive shopping experience. My contributions included implementing a componentized React architecture, Redux-based state management, and whitelabel theming to improve scalability. These updates allowed users to more easily locate retailers and discover Aeroplan earning opportunities, significantly improving engagement.
      
      **AODA AA / WCAG Compliance**: Leading Aeroplan’s accessibility initiative, I ensured their eStore met AODA AA and WCAG 2.0 compliance standards. This involved auditing the platform, implementing semantic HTML, and enhancing keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility. These changes ensured equitable access for all users and alignment with regulatory requirements.
      
      **eStore Initial Architecture and MVP**: I was instrumental in laying the groundwork for Aeroplan’s eStore by developing its initial architecture and MVP. This project involved designing scalable front-end and server-side solutions with React and Node.js, enabling future feature expansion. The MVP provided users with a streamlined way to redeem points online, setting a strong foundation for ongoing development.
      
      **Technical Innovations and Team Leadership**: Across all projects, I integrated modern development practices, including monorepos for streamlined code management, CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployments, and modular design systems for reusable components. I also led and mentored teams, ensuring consistent code quality, fostering knowledge sharing, and aligning technical solutions with business objectives.
      
      **Proposal Development and Client Engagement**: I collaborated with Aeroplan stakeholders to develop proposals for new projects, including feature enhancements, performance optimizations, and accessibility improvements. My contributions helped secure client buy-in for three engagements and align project goals with Aeroplan’s strategic vision.
      
      These contributions collectively elevated Aeroplan’s digital platform, driving user satisfaction and operational efficiency while adhering to stringent technical and regulatory standards. My work with Aeroplan exemplifies the power of combining technical expertise with a user-centered approach to deliver impactful, scalable solutions.

This period was defined by a passion for art history, architectural history, and the engineering aspects of design. My projects often involved creating architectural models that merged precision engineering with artistic creativity, paying homage to historic architecture through recreations and inspired works. I developed technical drawing skills, mastered 3D software like Revit, Fusion 360, and Blender, and crafted physical models that emphasized the relationship between form and function.

    intro:
      'During a self-directed bootcamp through FreeCodeCamp, I embarked on my journey from functional design, into software engineering, mastering full-stack JavaScript and blending my design expertise with technical development to create refined and functional user interfaces.',
    desc: 'As part of my self-directed bootcamp with FreeCodeCamp, I immersed myself in the foundations of software engineering, focusing on full-stack JavaScript, DOM, jQuery, Node.js, and Advanced MySQL Queries. This experience also emphasized understanding core DOM manipulation, implementing OAuth authentication, and mastering algorithms and data structures. FreeCodeCamp offered a structured yet flexible environment that allowed me to explore and build real-world projects at my own pace, fostering both technical skills and self-discipline. \n\nThis period was transformative, as I applied my background in functional design, color theory, and composition from OCAD to create interfaces that were minimalist yet polished and user-centric. 2015-2017, often regarded as a "golden age" of web development, was a time of immense growth for me. It provided a thriving environment to explore new ideas, combine my design and engineering passions, and establish the foundation for a full-fledged career in software development.',
